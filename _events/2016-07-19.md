# Using Support Vector Machines to gain insight into the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia

Predicting schizophrenia is incredibly hard, and remains a very prominent
challenge. Here I present the results of studies where machine learning
algorithms have been used to identify if there is evidence of interactions
between genetic mutations occurring. The outcomes of using real case/control
data is compared with simulated phenotypes to achieve this.

# To Catch a Criminal

Using incredibly low resolution CCTV, OpenCV and Python to catch buffoons that crash 
into cars and drive away. I will talk briefly about performing basic processing
on a video and using AutoTrader's site to find a culprit.
Note: You will require your own cheap CCTV to take part, I will provide it
for the purpose of this talk.
