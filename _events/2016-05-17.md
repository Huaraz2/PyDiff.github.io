# David R. MacIver - How do I know if this code works?

I have a problem. I write some code to solve that problem. How do I know if I succeeded?

If I only have to solve one form of the problem, I can just run it and look at the answer,
but most software has to deal with a huge variety of inputs and situations. How do you
know you haven’t missed something?

Property-based testing provides one answer to this question. Using the Hypothesis property
based testing library (and the py.test testing framework), we’ll see how we can create
those situations before our software ever escapes into the wild and test that it still
behaves correctly, thus giving us far more confidence in our code than we could otherwise
have had.
