# Using Python to Map Innovation in Wales

The web provides us with a new and powerful tool for measuring emerging innovative trends. It has a vast memory, capturing masses of highly detailed data about its users; and it is interconnected and interactive - it is easy to connect different datasets, republish data, and interact with it.

Businesses and policymakers are using an expanding arsenal of analytics technologies to manage and create value from this data. These tools can also help innovation policymakers whose job is to bolster new ideas and industries that drive growth.

During this talk I'll give examples of how, at [Nesta](www.nesta.org.uk), we are mapping innovation in Wales using Python.
